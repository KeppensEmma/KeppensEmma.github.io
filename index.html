        <p>I found this text really interesting. What Frank Romero says is really clear and simple. Even when it is about software, which is complicated. He explains things in an easy way to make it more understandable. He talks about that aspirins are just like computers, made the guts of our computers more potent, powerful, and smaller. He also says that the padding isn’t around the screens. It’s in them. Otherwise, we won't be able to grasp it or use it. 
Another thing that he talks about is plastic for which he shows us a video written by James Burke. The main subject here is plastic and why we should recognize it as a good and useful product that it can be anything. Like fake leather,… But people always want to have the “real stuff” and that is the problem. It has to change. Frank Romero thinks the same about this but then in place of thinking about plastic, he thinks about software. Like how software was an insult, nasty and complicated, just like fake leather. But he says that now it has changed and we just know software for what it is. And now it is everywhere. 
Which was also very interesting is the two ideological camps. Proponents of flat design ( people who say that because screens are flat, pictures should be to° and then you have people who believe in the value of skeuomorphs as near-tangible. but screens are output devices, after all. I really believe that Romero is going to change a lot about the way that people think about evolution and software.
